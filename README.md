##   Yuo can see my demo here:
- You can see my demo in this following link: [https://country-quiz-project.netlify.app/](https://country-quiz-project.netlify.app/).

## My experience:
- Frankly, I had a lot of struggles accomplishing this project. However, It went well.
Firstly, I grasped the use of Browserslist in the dependency, because I have trouble with that. This is because while I did not use it, I could not fetch the data, It gave me an error, but as soon as I inserted it in the dependency, it's done.

- Something I have never used before but I applied in this project is importing an image. Import the image as if you are to import a component so that you can use that filename inside of the source

## Anything I have learned/improved:

- While doing this project I leanred: firstly, using all the ways to deal with an array, such as find() and map().

- Apart from that, I starated to fully understand more about how to use Router and and Switch, as well as Link, and how they work.

## My wisdom:
- I tried to rely on google, I did a lot of research during while fulfilling this task.
