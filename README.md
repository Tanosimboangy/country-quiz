# *Yuo can see my demo here:*
- You can see my demo in this following link: [https://country-quiz-project.netlify.app/](https://country-quiz-project.netlify.app/).

# *My experience:*

 - Despite of the fact that I encountered a lot of struggles while creating this app, I am very proud that I could handle it.

 - Firstly, I fetched all of the data through this API [https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all). At first, I had a problem with my dependecy, because I did not have the browserslist in there, but as soon as I implemented this "browserslist" in my dependency it worked.

- Something I have never used before but I applied in this project is importing an image. Import the image as if you are to import a component so that you can use that filename inside of the source. This is quite interesting because it helps you to maintain your code clean and easily to understand.

# *Anything I have learned/improved:*

- While doing this project, I leanred: firstly, using all the ways to deal with an array, such as find(), map() and filter().

- Apart from that, I starated to fully understand more about how to use Router and and Switch, as well as Link, and how they work.

# *My wisdom:*

- In the face of bugs, I tried to do my best to fully understand what is going on before asking for help from google or anyone.

- I tried to rely on google, I did a lot of research during while fulfilling this task.
